# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-
Welcome to our Smart attendance system software, where we bring you a seamless combination of face recognition accuracy and global connectivity.In the dynamic landscape of modern education and workforce management, the conventional methods of attendance tracking have become increasingly obsolete and prone to inaccuracies. Recognizing this need for a more efficient, reliable, and secure system, the implementation of smart technologies has emerged as a promising solution. Among these technologies, face recognition stands out as a revolutionary tool that not only streamlines the attendance process but also enhances security measures. – it's a necessity.Face recognition has gotten a part of consideration due to its convenience in numerous diverse areas. It includes identifying and recognizing people from facial pictures or recordings. In computer vision and machine learning, face recognition has grown in popularity, and numerous
algorithms have been created over time.

# Objective-
The main objective of implementing a Smart Attendance System using face recognition technology is to revolutionize the traditional methods of attendance tracking by introducing a more efficient, accurate, and secure solution. This system aims to:

1.Enhance Efficiency: Streamline the attendance tracking process by automating data collection, thereby saving time and resources for both administrators and attendees.
2.Ensure Accuracy: Utilize advanced facial recognition algorithms to uniquely identify individuals, reducing the likelihood of errors or fraudulent practices such as buddy punching.
3.Improve Security: Enhance security measures by implementing biometric authentication, which provides a more reliable method of verifying individuals' identities compared to traditional methods like ID cards or passwords.
4.Provide Real-time Monitoring: Enable real-time monitoring of attendance data, allowing administrators to promptly address any discrepancies or issues that may arise.
5.Facilitate Data Analysis: Generate comprehensive attendance reports and insights, enabling administrators to make informed decisions and optimize resource allocation based on attendance patterns.

Overall, the primary objective of a Smart Attendance System is to optimize attendance management practices by leveraging cutting-edge technology to meet the evolving needs of modern institutions and organizations.

# Prerequsites
 Node.js 14 or later - install from https://nodejs.org/
 Python 3.x or later - install from https://www.python.org/

# Installing Python Packages
 Open the Terminal (Linux & MacOS) or PowerShell (Windows)
 Type "pip install numpy" after it gets installed.
 Type "pip install opencv-python" after it gets installed.
 Type "pip install requests" after it gets installed.
# Installing Face_Recognition module
 Type "pip install cmake" after it gets installed.
 Type "pip install dlib" after it gets installed.
Type "pip install face_recognition" after it gets installed.
Now if all the modules got installed correctly attendance.py should run correctly.

# Installing packages:
1.Download the repository:
https://github.com/Sahil08tab/Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-.git
2.Open the Terminal (Linux & MacOS) or PowerShell (Windows) and change directory to the project folder.
3.Type ‘npm install’ in the Terminal (PowerShell) and press Enter. All the dependencies would be installed.
4.Now make sure you are in backend folder. To open the application, type ‘npm run server’ and press Enter in the terminal.
5.The application should be live on the local port 8080.
Now go to face recognition folder and open attendance.py.

### **If all the packages got installed correctly the program should run without any problem.

# How to use it 📖

### Node Server
Open terminal in VS Code then type "npm run server". This should start your node server if you have installed all the packages
